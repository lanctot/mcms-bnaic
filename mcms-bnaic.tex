%The title of the article has to appear in bold and the \verb+\huge+ keyword has to be used to set the correct font size. For
%the authors and their affiliations, three cases are distinguished:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item One author: define the author with \verb+\author+ and the affiliation
%   with \verb+\date+.
%\item Multiple authors, all with the same affiliation: define the authors with
%   \verb+\author+, separated by \verb+\and+, and the affiliation with
%   \verb+\date+.
%\item Multiple authors, multiple affiliations: define the
%   authors with \verb+\author+. Put after each name a letter for the
%   affiliation, generated by \verb+\affila+, \verb+\affilb+, etc. On the
%   next lines: one affiliation per line, each preceded by the appropriate letter
%   generated by \verb+\affila+, \verb+\affilb+. See the title of this document.
